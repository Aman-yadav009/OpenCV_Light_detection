# OpenCV_Light_detection
this is just a simple OpenCV thing which i coded for my Robot to be able to detect light sources in surroundings, this helped me a lot to learn in OpenCV
Inspect_it.py is program in which the Bot takes images of four directions and decides on which direction has more light intensity and turns towards that direction
Hunting_cali.py is program which finds the cntre location of said light intensity and calibrates bot towards it before it begans to move
